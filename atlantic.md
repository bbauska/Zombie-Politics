Before we begin, a primer on the science of arranging an interview with a sitting American president:

In ordinary times, reporters seeking an on-the-record encounter with the commander in 
chief first write an elaborate proposal. The proposal details the goals of the interview, 
the broad areas of concern, and the many reasons the president must, for his own good, 
talk to these particular reporters and not other, perfectly adequate but still lesser 
reporters. This pitch is then sent to White House officials. If the universe bends 
favorably, negotiations ensue. If the staff feel reasonably confident that the interview 
will somehow help their cause, they will ask the president—with trepidation, at times—to 
sit for the interview. Sometimes, the president will agree.

Such is what happened recently to us. We went through this process in the course of 
reporting the story you are reading. We made our pitch, which went like this: President 
Donald Trump, by virtue of winning a second term and so dramatically reshaping the 
country and the world, can now be considered the most consequential American leader of 
the 21st century, and we want to describe, in detail, how this came to be. Just four 
years ago, after the violent insurrection he fomented, Trump appeared to be finished. 
Social-media companies had banned or suspended him, and he had been repudiated by 
corporate donors. Republicans had denounced him, and the country was moving on to the 
fresh start of Joe Biden’s presidency. Then came further blows—the indictments, the civil 
judgments, and the endless disavowals by people who once worked for him.

And yet, here we are, months into a second Trump term. We wanted to hear, in his own 
words, how he’d pulled off one of the most remarkable comebacks in political history, 
and what lessons, if any, he’d internalized along the way.

Trump agreed to see us. We were tentatively promised a meeting and a photo shoot—likely 
in the Oval Office, though possibly the Lincoln Bedroom. But then, as is so often the 
case with this White House, everything went sideways.

<h1>My Super-Special 79th Was Not Super Special<h1>
<h6><small>A diary entry by a disappointed president</small</h6>

Dear Diary,2025

I did NOT have the birthday of my dreams last weekend! Everyone knows that 79 is the tank 
birthday. One is paper, 77 is emoluments, 78 you get to destroy one constitutional 
amendment of your choosing, 80 you get to become the state, but 79 is tanks, and I was 
so looking forward to my tank birthday.

I thought it was pretty clear what I wanted. But obviously, it wasn’t!!! This was like 
the kind of tank parade your mom makes you lovingly from scratch, and I wanted the kind 
of tank parade that is made in China or North Korea. I don’t want a special American 
tank parade where our soldiers are waving and smiling out of the tanks. I want one like 
my friends have.

I wanted tanks, but I got OLD tanks. I wanted marching, but I got the wrong kind of 
marching, where they didn’t even do the little high-kick thing. I wanted millions of 
people to come out and cheer and hold up pictures of my face and they did, but they all 
went to the wrong places.

What does a president have to do to get the right kind of birthday tank parade? I have 
been dispatching troops to American cities and Stephen Miller is openly speculating about 
rolling back habeas corpus; it is not even subtle at this point what kind of government 
I’m going for!
