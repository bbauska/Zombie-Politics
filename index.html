		<h4>According to a review article by Paul Kingsbury, a cultural geographer who has 
		studied crop circles extensively, there are several characteristics of crop circle 
		formations that have been observed or reported by researchers. Some of these 
		characteristics are:</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Crop circles are usually found in cereal crops such as wheat, barley, or 
		  canola, but they can also appear in other crops such as corn, soybean, 
		  rapeseed, or sunflower.</li>
		<li>Crop circles can vary in size from a few meters to hundreds of meters in 
		  diameter. The largest crop circle ever recorded was 800 meters long and 350 
		  meters wide in Milk Hill, England in 2001.</li>
        <li>Crop circles can have simple or complex designs, ranging from circles to 
		  ellipses to polygons to fractals to pictograms. Some crop circles have multiple 
		  layers or elements that form intricate patterns or symbols.</li>
		<li>Crop circles can appear overnight or during the day, but they are usually 
		  discovered in the morning by farmers or aerial observers. Some crop circles 
		  have been witnessed being formed by mysterious lights or sounds in the sky.</li>
		<li>Crop circles are not randomly distributed across the landscape but tend to 
		  cluster near roads, population centers, or cultural heritage sites such as 
		  Stonehenge or Avebury. Nearly half of all crop circles found in the UK in 
		  2003 were located within a 15 kilometers radius of the Avebury stone circles.</li>
      </ul>
